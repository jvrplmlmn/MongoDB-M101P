    mongo < create_student_collection.js

### Quiz: Pymongo: find, find_one and Cursors

In the following code snippet:

    import pymongo
    import sys
    
    # establish a connection to the database 
    # note this uses the now deprecated Connection class, as we did in the lecture.
    # MongoClient is the preferred way of connecting.
    connection = pymongo.Connection("mongodb://localhost", safe=True)
    
    # get a handle to the school database
    db=connection.school
    scores = db.scores
         
    try:
            xxxx
            
    except:
            print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
    
    
    print doc

please enter the one line of python code that would be needed in in place of xxxx to find one document in the collection.

    doc = scores.find_one()
    
## Pymongo: Using field Selection     

Code:

    python using_find_with_selector.py

### Quiz: Pymongo: Using field Selection 

Which of the following could work using Pymongo, depending on variable names, to select out just the student_id from the scores collection using a find command.

- cursor = students.find({'student_id':1, '_id':0})
- cursor = students.find({'student_id':1})
- **cursor = students.find({}, {'student_id':1, '_id':0})**
- cursor = students.find({}, {student_id:1, _id:0})

## Pymongo: Using $gt and $lt

Code:

    find_using_gt_lt.py

### Quiz: Pymongo: Using $gt and $lt

In the following code, what is the correct line of code, marked by xxxx, to search for all quiz scores that are greater than 20 and less than 90.

    import pymongo
    import sys
    
    # establish a connection to the database
    connection = pymongo.Connection("mongodb://localhost", safe=True)
    
    # get a handle to the school database
    db=connection.school
    scores = db.scores
    
    
    def find():
    
        print "find, reporting for duty"
    
        xxxx
    
        try:
            iter = scores.find(query)
    
        except:
            print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
            
        return iter
    
    find()


- query = {'score':{'$gt':20, '$lt':90}}
- **query = {'type':'quiz', 'score':{'$gt':20, '$lt':90}}**
- query = {'type':'quiz', '$gt':{'score':20}, '$lt':{'score':90}}
- query = {'type':'quiz', 'score':{$gt:20, $lt:90}}
